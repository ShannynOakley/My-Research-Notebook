<p>Note 2</p>

<p>Excercise 2 was a lot more difficult than I was anticipating. My version on Windows 10 looked a lot different that the screenshot used in the example so it took some time to figure out but once I got it working it was pretty easy.
The spreadsheet has the url, the time/date, and all the translations that were found for the search word. This would be very useful when trying to get small percise details from a large result base &ndash; like the information given in the CWGC excercise from before, you could set it up to read first name, last name, age, rank, and/or date of death.</p>
