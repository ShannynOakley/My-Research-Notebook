Module 5, poster exercise 
Powerpoint poster: https://www.flickr.com/photos/hippoalmighty/8729978193/in/pool-pimpmyposter/

Good points:
- Uses different fonts and styles to emphasize specific points
- Has a scan symbol so that readers can access more information about the project 
- Entire poster takes less than 10 minutes to read 

Bad points:
- Space is not used effectively
- Fushia used for title and ending 
- Pictures and text are not balanced 
- Some of the lines do not flow properly
- A few words have been messed up in the transfer (awkward spacing in the word significantly) 
- Overall flow can be improved to allow for more easibility when reading it 

Ways to improve:
- Changing the colour of the font to be more cohesive with the message that's trying to be shown 
- Reoganizing paragraph and photo placements to be more visually pleasing and balanced 
- Match the colours used in the graphs to eachother so that they are not competing against one another (this would also improve the eye-flow) 
- Choosing a more "academic" font that would be more serious than the more casual one currently being used 
- Removing one or two of the images
