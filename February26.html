<p>Note</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m a bit behind &ndash; at least I am not where I wanted to be at this time. This is in part because of faulty internet access, the flu, and the fact that I am swamped with assignments for my seminars.
I wanted to be at least part way (if not done) module 3 by the end of reading week but that hasn&rsquo;t happened&hellip;so I am now aiming for next week.</p>
