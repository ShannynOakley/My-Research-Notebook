If I had used a data sorter or reader like the one in the last exercise in my last major term assignment I would have saved a lot of time and effort. My project called for me to use the transcriptions of hundreds of grave markers in the Upper Canada Pioneer Memorial cemetery, I then had to comb through this data, find and organize patterns. This took a good two weeks to work through, being able to tell a program to do some of this for me really would have been helpful since there are only so may things a basic version of Excel spreadsheets can do. It also would have helped group together family members since sometimes last names were a letter or two off or had been transcribed in a different spelling - having a separate program looking for these instead of me having to carefully read each row would have been nice.
