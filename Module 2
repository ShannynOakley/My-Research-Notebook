## Data searches for CWGC and Epigraphs 

Canadian War Graves Commission 
==============================
- This is a search database that I am very familiar with, my high school history teacher gave out many assignments related to it.
- I searched for the lastname Carr which was my paternal grandmother's maiden name, her brother Wellington had served in WWI.
- For the search critia, I put Canadian Forces and First World War.
- [My results](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1)

###
Epigraphic Database Heidelberg 
==============================
- This is a database that I had never heard about so I was a bit confused as to what critia needed to be filled out. 
- Like the excersise itself suggested, I searched for Figlin and thankfully only got 63 results. 
- [My results](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche?hd_nr=&land=&fo_antik=&fo_modern=&literatur=&dat_jahr_a=&dat_jahr_e=&atext1=figlin&bool=AND&atext2=&sort=hd_nr&anzahl=20)

*Right now, my data is just being stored in a file, I am not entirely sure if I'm supposed to put it in this notebook*
