<p>Why I am Taking HIST3907
Digital History</p>

<pre><code>To gain a better understaning of how history can be adapted to fit the modern world

In 2016, history is already progressing away from just being written down in books and printed articles; the rise in SMS like Twitter and Instagram mean that we now need to understand how these posts can be turned into creditable sources and bibliography references.

To build a perfessonial online record of myself

I plan on getting a career in geneology, and with so many immigration records being available online now through Ancestry.ca I think that it is important for me to learn more digital-related skills that might help in my futer job prospects.

<p>In high school, I took a Computer Business class that taught me basic HTML programming as well as how to use those skills to make a fake store website and a 1990â€™s-style game.</p>

<p>After this course, however, I would like to be able to build an online portfolio that I can use to show potential employers my skills in digital history.</p>
