<h2>Negro Slavery; or, A View of Some of the More Prominent Features of

<p> ...ease of the Black population has a better chance of being at least understood by them than us. Accordingly,
                  in some of the old states, and in all which have been recently admitted into the Union, slavery has been formally 
                  excluded from their constitution. The whole of the Eastern and a great part of the Central States, and many 
                  enlightened individuals even in the southern provinces, particularly the Quakers <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" title="Quakers involvement in the Abolition movementE2BN and MLA East of London, Quakers/Society of Friends in The Abolition Project, available at http://abolition.e2bn.org/people_21.html"></a>,

                  the system of slavery. It is true, that, for the most part, they oppose it rather as a great political evil,

				  withdraw it. The advantage which America possesses in this important respect, would encourage a hope of 
				  eventual extinction of the evil at no very distant period, at least, at an earlier period than it would be 
				  reasonable to expect it in our own colonial possessions, but for another circumstance on which Mr. Hall <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/thumbnails/H/ColonelFrancisHall.pdf" title="Hall, Francis(-)Lieutenant"></a>,
