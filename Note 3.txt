Note 3

Due to the fact that I am a poor university student, I actually have a limited amount of data each month so I had to wait until a new one started in order to download the necessary tools for the next exercise.
I should be fine now but hopefully they won't be too large so that I'll be able to work through the next module or two this month as well.
